# Environment Setup: linorobot2 Docker with Tmuxinator

This guide walks you through getting the simulation environment up and running using the linorobot2 Docker setup.

Reference: [linorobot2 Docker documentation](https://linorobot.github.io/linorobot2/docker/)

---

## 1. One-Time Setup

> If the Docker image has already been built and Tmuxinator is installed, skip to Part 2.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- A terminal in the directory where you want to clone the repository

### 1.0 - Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linorobot/linorobot2
cd linorobot2
```

All subsequent steps assume your terminal is at the repository root (`linorobot2/`).

### 1.1 - Configure the Docker environment

Navigate into the `docker` folder and open the `.env` file:

```bash
cd docker
nano .env
```

Set `BASE_IMAGE` based on your machine:

- `gazebo` — for machines **without** an NVIDIA GPU
- `gazebo-cuda` — for machines with a **CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU**

```
BASE_IMAGE=gazebo
```

If your machine has an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed, use this instead for hardware-accelerated rendering:

```
BASE_IMAGE=gazebo-cuda
```

Save and close the file.

### 1.2 - Build the Docker image

From inside the `docker` folder, run the build script:

```bash
./build
```

This will build the image with your host user's permissions so files created inside the container are owned by you. This step may take a few minutes the first time.

### 1.3 - Install Tmuxinator

Tmuxinator manages named tmux sessions from a YAML config. It acts like a launch file for the entire simulation stack, starting all required containers and arranging their output into named panes in one terminal.

Follow the installation instructions at: https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator?tab=readme-ov-file#installation

A quick install on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install tmuxinator
```

## 2. Starting the Development Session

> Start here if the Docker image has already been built and Tmuxinator is installed.

### Prerequisites

- The linorobot2 Docker image has been built
- Tmuxinator is installed
- A terminal at the repository root

### 2.1 - Set the Tmuxinator config path

Source the tmux setup script to register the linorobot2 profiles with Tmuxinator:

```bash
source setup_tmux.bash
```

Verify that the profiles are detected:

```bash
tmuxinator ls
```

You should see:

```
tmuxinator projects:
dev       hardware  sim
```

### 2.2 - Start the dev session

Launch the dev profile:

> **Note:** This course uses the `dev` profile rather than `sim`. The `sim` profile
> auto-launches a full Nav2 demo stack, whereas `dev` gives you four independent
> bash panes so you can manually launch and control each ROS 2 process yourself.

```bash
tmuxinator start dev
```

This starts the `dev` container and a KasmVNC server, then opens a tmux window with four bash panes ready for development.

> **Tip:** The `linorobot2_ws/src` directory inside the container is a shared volume — it maps directly to the `linorobot2_ws/src` folder inside the cloned repository on your host machine. This means you can open and edit files from your host using your favourite IDE, and changes will be immediately visible inside the container without any copying or syncing.

Once everything is up, open your browser and go to:

```
http://<your_machine_ip>:3000
```

You will see the Gazebo simulation running in the browser window. A robot will be spawned in the world and ready to use. The tmux session opens 6 independent terminals you can use to follow the exercises in this repository.

> **Note:** The first time you use any of the 6 terminals, remember to source the workspace:
> ```bash
> source ~/linorobot2_ws/install/setup.bash
> ```

> **Note:** The standard way to work with ROS is through a native system installation (see [Ubuntu Development Setup](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Alternatives/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html)). This Docker + Tmuxinator approach is simply a convenient way to quickly get through the exercises in this repository without a full system install.

### Navigating the Tmux Session

Once the session is running, you will see multiple panes in your terminal. Each pane is an interactive shell exec'd into the `dev` container.

Useful key bindings:

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` then arrow keys | Move between panes |
| `Ctrl+B` then `D` | Detach from the session (everything keeps running) |

To reattach to a detached session:

```bash
tmux attach -t dev
```

### 2.3 - Verify the environment

In any free pane, confirm ROS 2 is active:

```bash
ros2 topic list
```

You should see:

```
ros@sim:~/linorobot2_ws$ ros2 topic list
/parameter_events
/rosout
```

This confirms the ROS 2 environment is up. No extra sourcing is needed - the ROS 2 environment is sourced automatically when each pane starts.

To use packages from the linorobot2 workspace, source it once in your pane:

```bash
source ~/linorobot2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

### Stopping the Session

To stop the session, first detach if you are attached (`Ctrl+B` then `D`), then run:

```bash
tmuxinator stop dev
```

To fully remove all running containers:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose down
```
